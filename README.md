I am an incoming Postdoctoral Researcher at Caltech in the Computing and Mathematical Sciences department working with Prof. Soon-Jo Chung and Prof. Fred Hadaegh at the Autonomous Robotics and Controls Lab. I obtained my PhD in Aerospace Engineering PhD from UT Austin working at the intersection of motion planning, trajectory optimization, control theory, data-driven control, and robotics. My current research includes safe learning-based control, optimization and motion planning.

I have previously interned at GAMMA Lab. of the University of Maryland under the advise of Prof. Dinesh Manocha on online motion planning and trajectory optimization algorithms. I have also interned at Airbus and Honeywell Aerospace, India.

Prior to joining UT, I worked with Prof. Satadal Ghosh on developing fast and efficient sampling-based motion planning and trajectory optimization based algorithms during my bachelor's at IIT Madras.
